Hi! I'm Florina. I am based in Connecticut and originally from Indonesia.
<br><br>
I am passionate about storytelling in all of its dynamic forms:  

digital humanities
<br><br>
I recently completed the Lede Program for Data Journalism at Columbia University, where I worked on data-driven stories that incorporated various storytelling, analyses, and visualization techniques. You can find my works <a href="index.html#main">here</a>.
<br><br>
I am currently developing a freelance piece on fandom and fanfiction trends for <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>. Fun fact, The Pudding kickstarted my interest in data journalism!
